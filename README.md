# phoneme-qtopia
A port of phoneME Java VM to Qtopia 4.X

This project is a fork of https://github.com/borman/phoneme-qtopia.
It's tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and needs qvfb as a virtual framebuffer.
You can get qvfb @ https://github.com/arnoldlu/qvfb-1.1/blob/master/qvfb/qvfb for x86_64 Ubuntu.

Any question, you can mail arnoldlu@qq.com.
